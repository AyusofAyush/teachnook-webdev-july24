### JS Async programming

### Asynchronous Programming in JavaScript

Asynchronous programming is a paradigm that allows a program to perform tasks such as fetching data from a server, reading files, or performing other operations without blocking the main thread of execution. This is crucial for maintaining a responsive user interface and improving the overall performance of applications.

### Key Concepts

#### Callback Functions
A callback function is a function passed as an argument to another function, which is then executed after the completion of some operation.

**Example**:
```javascript
function fetchData(callback) {
    setTimeout(() => {
        console.log("Data fetched");
        callback();
    }, 1000);
}

function processData() {
    console.log("Processing data");
}

fetchData(processData);
```

**Study**: `Callback Hell problem in Javascript`

#### Promises
A Promise is an object representing the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation. It can be in one of three states: pending, fulfilled, or rejected.

**Example**:
```javascript
function fetchData() {
    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
        setTimeout(() => {
            console.log("Data fetched");
            resolve("Data");
        }, 1000);
    });
}

fetchData().then(data => {
    console.log("Processing", data);
}).catch(error => {
    console.error("Error:", error);
});
```

#### Async/Await
Async/Await is syntactic sugar built on top of Promises, providing a more readable and straightforward way to handle asynchronous code.

**Example**:
```javascript
async function fetchData() {
    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
        setTimeout(() => {
            console.log("Data fetched");
            resolve("Data");
        }, 1000);
    });
}

async function processData() {
    try {
        const data = await fetchData();
        console.log("Processing", data);
    } catch (error) {
        console.error("Error:", error);
    }
}

processData();
```

**Watch**: `What the heck is Event Loop ? (30 mins)`

### Event Loop

The event loop is a fundamental part of JavaScript's concurrency model. It allows JavaScript to perform non-blocking I/O operations by offloading operations to the system kernel whenever possible.

#### How the Event Loop Works:

1. **Call Stack**: The call stack is where the JavaScript engine keeps track of function calls. Functions are pushed onto the stack when called and popped off when they return.
2. **Web APIs**: Browsers provide Web APIs that handle asynchronous tasks like `setTimeout`, `fetch`, and DOM events. When these tasks are completed, they push callback functions to the Task Queue.
3. **Task Queue**: A queue where callback functions are pushed once their associated asynchronous tasks are complete.
4. **Event Loop**: Continuously checks the call stack and the task queue. If the call stack is empty, the event loop moves the first callback from the task queue to the call stack for execution.

#### Example:

```javascript
console.log("Start");

setTimeout(() => {
    console.log("Timeout");
}, 1000);

console.log("End");
```

**Output**:
```
Start
End
Timeout
```

Hereâ€™s how the event loop handles this:

1. `console.log("Start")` is executed and logged to the console.
2. `setTimeout` is called and its callback is sent to the Web API, with a timer set for 1000ms.
3. `console.log("End")` is executed and logged to the console.
4. After 1000ms, the timer completes, and the callback is pushed to the Task Queue.
5. The Event Loop sees the call stack is empty, so it pushes the callback from the Task Queue to the call stack.
6. The callback `console.log("Timeout")` is executed and logged to the console.

### Summary

- **Asynchronous programming** in JavaScript allows non-blocking operations.
- **Callback functions** handle asynchronous operations but can lead to "callback hell."
- **Promises** provide a cleaner, more manageable way to handle async operations.
- **Async/Await** offers a more readable syntax for working with Promises.
- The **Event Loop** is the mechanism that allows JavaScript to perform non-blocking operations, ensuring the main thread remains responsive.


## Summary of the Interative TODO list

Creating an interactive Todo list using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript involves understanding how to manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM) to dynamically add, remove, and mark items as complete. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you understand the basics and the JavaScript concepts involved.

### Step 1: Setting Up the HTML

First, create a simple HTML structure for the Todo list.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Todo List</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
</head>
<body>
    <div class="container">
        <h1>Todo List</h1>
        <input type="text" id="todo-input" placeholder="Add a new task">
        <button id="add-button">Add</button>
        <ul id="todo-list"></ul>
    </div>
    <script src="script.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

### Step 2: Adding Basic CSS

Next, add some basic styling to make the Todo list look better.

```css
/* styles.css */

body {
    font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
    display: flex;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
    height: 100vh;
    margin: 0;
    background-color: #f4f4f4;
}

.container {
    background: white;
    padding: 20px;
    border-radius: 5px;
    box-shadow: 0 0 10px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);
    width: 300px;
    text-align: center;
}

input, button {
    padding: 10px;
    margin: 5px 0;
    width: 100%;
    box-sizing: border-box;
}

ul {
    list-style: none;
    padding: 0;
}

li {
    padding: 10px;
    background: #eee;
    margin-bottom: 5px;
    display: flex;
    justify-content: space-between;
    align-items: center;
}

li.completed {
    text-decoration: line-through;
    color: #888;
}
```

### Step 3: Writing JavaScript

Now, let's write the JavaScript to make the Todo list interactive.

```javascript
// script.js

document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {
    const input = document.getElementById('todo-input');
    const addButton = document.getElementById('add-button');
    const todoList = document.getElementById('todo-list');

    // Event listener to add a new todo item
    addButton.addEventListener('click', () => {
        const todoText = input.value.trim();
        if (todoText) {
            addTodoItem(todoText);
            input.value = '';
        }
    });

    // Function to add a new todo item
    function addTodoItem(text) {
        const li = document.createElement('li');
        li.textContent = text;

        // Create a delete button for each todo item
        const deleteButton = document.createElement('button');
        deleteButton.textContent = 'Delete';
        deleteButton.addEventListener('click', () => {
            li.remove();
        });

        // Toggle completion status on click
        li.addEventListener('click', () => {
            li.classList.toggle('completed');
        });

        li.appendChild(deleteButton);
        todoList.appendChild(li);
    }
});
```

### Explanation of JavaScript Code

1. **DOM Content Loaded Event**: `document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => { ... });`
   - This ensures the JavaScript code runs only after the HTML content is fully loaded.

2. **Querying DOM Elements**:
   ```javascript
   const input = document.getElementById('todo-input');
   const addButton = document.getElementById('add-button');
   const todoList = document.getElementById('todo-list');
   ```
   - `document.getElementById` is used to get the input field, add button, and the todo list `<ul>` element.

3. **Event Listener for Add Button**:
   ```javascript
   addButton.addEventListener('click', () => {
       const todoText = input.value.trim();
       if (todoText) {
           addTodoItem(todoText);
           input.value = '';
       }
   });
   ```
   - This adds an event listener to the "Add" button that triggers when the button is clicked.
   - `input.value.trim()` gets the text from the input field and removes any leading/trailing whitespace.
   - If the input is not empty, it calls the `addTodoItem` function and then clears the input field.

4. **Function to Add Todo Item**:
   ```javascript
   function addTodoItem(text) {
       const li = document.createElement('li');
       li.textContent = text;

       const deleteButton = document.createElement('button');
       deleteButton.textContent = 'Delete';
       deleteButton.addEventListener('click', () => {
           li.remove();
       });

       li.addEventListener('click', () => {
           li.classList.toggle('completed');
       });

       li.appendChild(deleteButton);
       todoList.appendChild(li);
   }
   ```
   - `document.createElement('li')` creates a new `<li>` element for the todo item.
   - `li.textContent = text` sets the text content of the `<li>` to the todo item text.
   - A delete button is created and an event listener is added to remove the `<li>` element when clicked.
   - An event listener is added to the `<li>` to toggle the `completed` class when clicked.
   - The delete button is appended to the `<li>`, and the `<li>` is appended to the `<ul>` todo list.

This is the basic structure of creating an interactive Todo list using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. You can expand this by adding more features like editing items, storing them in local storage, or adding animations.
