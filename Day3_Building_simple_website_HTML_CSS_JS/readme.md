## Overview of Website Development 

### Brief Overview of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

#### HTML (HyperText Markup Language)
HTML is the standard markup language used to create and structure web pages. It defines the content of the web pages using various tags and elements.
- **Structure:** HTML provides the skeleton of the web page.
- **Elements:** Common elements include headings (`<h1>` to `<h6>`), paragraphs (`<p>`), links (`<a>`), images (`<img>`), and forms (`<form>`).
- **Attributes:** These provide additional information about elements, like `href` for links or `src` for images.

#### CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)
CSS is used to describe the presentation of a web page, including layout, colors, and fonts.
- **Styling:** CSS applies styles to HTML elements.
- **Selectors:** CSS selectors target HTML elements to apply styles (e.g., classes, IDs, or element types).
- **Box Model:** Understanding margin, border, padding, and content to control layout.
- **Responsive Design:** Media queries and flexible layouts for different devices.

#### JavaScript
JavaScript is a programming language that enables interactive and dynamic content on web pages.
- **Interactivity:** Adding events like clicks, hovers, and form submissions.
- **DOM Manipulation:** Changing HTML and CSS dynamically.
- **APIs:** Interacting with external services (e.g., REST APIs) and browser APIs (e.g., Geolocation, Local Storage).
- **Frameworks/Libraries:** Tools like React, Angular, and Vue.js simplify complex tasks.

## What is Flexbox in CSS ?

### Flexbox Guide

Flexbox, or the Flexible Box Layout, is a CSS layout module designed to provide a more efficient way to lay out, align, and distribute space among items in a container, even when their size is unknown or dynamic. Here's a breakdown of its components and usage with simple explanations and examples.

#### Flex Container
The flex container is the parent element that contains flex items. To create a flex container, set the `display` property to `flex` or `inline-flex`.

```css
.container {
  display: flex;
}
```

#### Flex Items
Flex items are the children of a flex container. By default, they are laid out in a row and stretch to fit the container.

```html
<div class="container">
  <div class="item">Item 1</div>
  <div class="item">Item 2</div>
  <div class="item">Item 3</div>
</div>
```

### Main Flexbox Properties

#### 1. **flex-direction**
Determines the direction of the flex items.

- `row` (default): left to right
- `row-reverse`: right to left
- `column`: top to bottom
- `column-reverse`: bottom to top

```css
.container {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: row; /* or column, row-reverse, column-reverse */
}
```

#### 2. **justify-content**
Aligns flex items along the main axis (horizontal by default).

- `flex-start` (default): items start from the beginning of the container
- `flex-end`: items end at the end of the container
- `center`: items are centered
- `space-between`: space between items
- `space-around`: space around items

```css
.container {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center; /* or flex-start, flex-end, space-between, space-around */
}
```

#### 3. **align-items**
Aligns flex items along the cross axis (vertical by default).

- `stretch` (default): items stretch to fill the container
- `flex-start`: items start at the beginning of the container
- `flex-end`: items end at the end of the container
- `center`: items are centered
- `baseline`: items align at their baseline

```css
.container {
  display: flex;
  align-items: center; /* or flex-start, flex-end, stretch, baseline */
}
```

#### 4. **flex-wrap**
Allows flex items to wrap onto multiple lines.

- `nowrap` (default): items do not wrap
- `wrap`: items wrap onto multiple lines
- `wrap-reverse`: items wrap onto multiple lines in reverse order

```css
.container {
  display: flex;
  flex-wrap: wrap; /* or nowrap, wrap-reverse */
}
```

#### 5. **align-content**
Aligns flex lines when there is extra space in the cross axis. This property has no effect when there is only one line of flex items.

- `stretch` (default): lines stretch to fill the container
- `flex-start`: lines start at the beginning of the container
- `flex-end`: lines end at the end of the container
- `center`: lines are centered
- `space-between`: space between lines
- `space-around`: space around lines

```css
.container {
  display: flex;
  flex-wrap: wrap;
  align-content: center; /* or flex-start, flex-end, stretch, space-between, space-around */
}
```

### Flex Item Properties

#### 1. **order**
Defines the order of flex items. Items are ordered by ascending order value.

```css
.item {
  order: 2; /* default is 0 */
}
```

#### 2. **flex-grow**
Defines the ability for a flex item to grow if necessary. Accepts a unitless value that serves as a proportion.

```css
.item {
  flex-grow: 1; /* default is 0 */
}
```

#### 3. **flex-shrink**
Defines the ability for a flex item to shrink if necessary. Accepts a unitless value that serves as a proportion.

```css
.item {
  flex-shrink: 1; /* default is 1 */
}
```

#### 4. **flex-basis**
Defines the initial size of a flex item before it is adjusted according to flex-grow and flex-shrink.

```css
.item {
  flex-basis: 100px; /* default is auto */
}
```

#### 5. **align-self**
Allows the default alignment (or the one specified by align-items) to be overridden for individual flex items.

- `auto` (default)
- `flex-start`
- `flex-end`
- `center`
- `baseline`
- `stretch`

```css
.item {
  align-self: center; /* or flex-start, flex-end, baseline, stretch */
}
```

### Examples

#### Basic Flexbox Layout

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<style>
  .container {
    display: flex;
    justify-content: space-between;
    align-items: center;
    height: 200px;
    border: 1px solid black;
  }
  .item {
    width: 100px;
    height: 100px;
    background-color: lightblue;
    text-align: center;
    line-height: 100px;
  }
</style>
</head>
<body>

<div class="container">
  <div class="item">Item 1</div>
  <div class="item">Item 2</div>
  <div class="item">Item 3</div>
</div>

</body>
</html>
```

#### Responsive Flexbox Layout

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<style>
  .container {
    display: flex;
    flex-wrap: wrap;
    justify-content: center;
    gap: 10px; /* space between items */
  }
  .item {
    flex: 1 1 200px; /* grow, shrink, basis */
    background-color: lightcoral;
    text-align: center;
    padding: 20px;
    margin: 5px;
    box-sizing: border-box;
  }
</style>
</head>
<body>

<div class="container">
  <div class="item">Item 1</div>
  <div class="item">Item 2</div>
  <div class="item">Item 3</div>
  <div class="item">Item 4</div>
  <div class="item">Item 5</div>
</div>

</body>
</html>
```

In the responsive example, items will wrap and adjust their size based on the available space, making it flexible for different screen sizes.

Flexbox is a powerful layout module that simplifies the process of designing flexible and responsive layouts. Understanding its properties and usage can significantly enhance your web development skills.
